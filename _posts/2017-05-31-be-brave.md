You're going to reach a point in life where this hits home. If I can help it hit a little sooner, I'll consider this note a success. One day, you will wake up and the burdens and fear will have piled up to a point that you'll realize there's no one around you that can pull you out. Not even me. It will scare you a lot. The fortress of support that you believed would hold forever will show cracks at the foundations. You may even be paralyzed by fear, and you won't know how to get through.

This will be the test of your reserve and your training. While I can't pull you through, I can give you the tools and the hope you need to succeed. Because while there won't be anyone around you who can help you, you're not alone. You have a Creator who loves you and He's even there in the worst case scenario. As soon as you learn to resign the burdens that you were never meant to carry, you will experience the freedom that needs no fortress to contain and protect it.

Go out, be brave, and explore who you were meant to be. You don't need a safety net, you already have everything you need to find the work that fulfills you and the life you were meant to live.

Love, \\
Dad
