You've already started to pick up on this. You should know by the time you read this that your dad is... weird. I don't do the same kinds of things as everyone else, and I don't think like other people think. I generally take the hard way where there's an easy one available if I think there's something to be learned. I try to solve problems my way first and then I look at how other people solved the same problem. My ideas are rarely the best ones in comparison, but that's not a problem to me.

I do things on principle even when it would be possible to take a shortcut when no one would know the difference. I believe that character is built through adversity, so I welcome challenging times because of the growth they will cause. Sometimes I just dance or sing or act like a goof. (This is sure to provide entertainment and embarrassment to you.)

I'm weird. I want you to be weird too.

Love, \\
Dad
