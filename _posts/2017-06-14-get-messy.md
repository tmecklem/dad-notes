Life is messy. It's full of trouble waiting for you to find it. Among other things, you'll find yourself in relationships with manipulative people, you'll encounter difficult financial problems that don't have easy answers, and you'll make decisions that lead to consequences no one could have foreseen. Each of your choices will lead to other choices. Everything builds on something in the past. Because of that, seek simplicity.

Learn how to take complex problems and break them down into pieces and tackle each smaller bit one at a time. Treat people fairly and seek out friends who do the same. When faced with multiple choices, choose the simplest thing that achieves your goal. Because just like when you mixed Play-Doh colors together as a kid, you'll find that some things in life can't be undone. Be purposeful about the small decisions and you won't regret the big places that leads you.

Get messy with life. There's no other choice sometimes, so you might as well get used to it. Then learn how to spot simplicity and choose it when you can.

Love, \\
Dad
