You're going to lose something or someone important to you. It will hurt in ways you don't understand, and the hurt will live inside emotions that don't make sense. You'll feel angry, sorrow, regret, shame, misery, emptiness, hopelessness and even sometimes joy. The most important thing is to identify that you're feeling the loss. Sometimes it's easy because it's a friend or colleague or relative you lose. Other times it won't be as easy to understand the source of the grief, especially when you lose a _thing_ or a disproved idea you've long held as true.

When you struggle with loss, you need to understand that it's okay. If you fight the feelings, they will linger like an unwanted houseguest and mess up other parts of your life until you accept and address them. Live in the moment of the pain, accept that it's real, and lean on your faith and your friends to help you through the parts you can't manage alone. It's a gift to your friends to allow them to help you, and you'll need the help anyway. Win-win.

One final note: you will lose something important to you no matter how hard you try to avoid it. Don't try to avoid the pain of loss by avoiding meaningful relationships and dreams.  You need those. Without them your heart will grow cold and hard and you'll end up far worse by withdrawing than you would in dealing with the pain of loss.

Love freely. Accept the loss that comes as part of the deal.

Love, \\
Dad
