The things you'll be the most proud of in your life are the things you fight hard for and win only through perserverance, grit, and something intangible that pushes you to keep going.

The easy goals are like sugary candy. They taste good for a minute but leave that nasty feeling on your teeth. You'll enjoy achieving an easy goal, but the joy is fleeting and leaves almost as soon as it comes.

Make audacious goals, make smaller ones that push you in the right direction, and structure your life in support of those meaningful goals. Don't fall for the trap of an easy life, because satisfaction doesn't come from ease and instant gratification. Defer pleasure, endure a little pain, and reap the rewards of a life well worn.

Like a cherished book with worn binding and torn pages, the book of your life will be full of stories and well read by people around you.

Love, \\
Dad
